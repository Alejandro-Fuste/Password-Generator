# Password Generator Homework

## Description

The goal is of this homework assignment is to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your Javascript code. 

In this code, the user is asked to choose, via prompts, the following criteria:

1. Length (choose between 8 and 128)
2. Uppercase letters
3. Lowercase letters
4. Numbers
5. Special Characters

The password that generates will depend on the answers from the prompts; however, the password will at least have
one character type (lowercase letters). As a bonus, my code contains a function (at the bottom & commented out) 
that generates a random password with all the previously listed criteria. This function does not have prompts and 
will be between 8 and 128 characters.  

The following is a picture of the completed application:
